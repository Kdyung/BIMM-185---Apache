Web-Implemented Enrichment Mapping using DAVID Prototype
====================
README
Author: Kyra Yung
Date: April 27th, 2014

Required Software
===
Using DAVID Web client for python requires suds (a lightweight SOAP python client for consuming Web Services) 
Download and install suds-0.4 (orlater version) from https://fedorahosted.org/suds/
Suds requires python-setuptools-devel to install. Link: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions

Project Status:

5-18-14
Working on connecting to DAVID still, there are some problems such as complications communicating with the DAVID API. It is unknown whether it is preferable to use the web service python client (which is currently returning HTTP errors) or using the url (which returns dubiuos output).






Directory Descriptions
